                            <h1>Mission</h1>
                            <p class="big">Bit by Bit was founded in response to an alarming trend of increasing gentrification in the Bay Area.</p>
                            <p class="mission">Here, tech companies attract money that spills over into surrounding residential areas, inflating living costs--especially for housing and food. For communities whose families aren’t involved in engineering or computer science, these price escalations can wreak havoc on living conditions and seed apprehension of further market growth.<br/><br/>

Our goal is to connect low-income families and tech companies. We aim to do so by creating mentorship programs in which engineers and software developers can lead underserved families through coding sessions, tech tours, and computer literacy programs, among other initiatives. <br/><br/>

Our target audience for coding sessions are children and young adults. The purpose of these sessions is to familiarize youth with programming syntax, so that they aren’t intimidated by the tech companies that flank their communities. Tech tours supplement the coding sessions, providing youth with a glimpse of what the industry has to offer. Computer literacy programs are geared toward adults who may have never learned how to navigate modern devices, focusing on common programs (i.e., Adobe Reader, Microsoft Word, web browsers, etc).<br/><br/>

We hope that low-income communities will no longer be marginalized by industry behemoths. Instead, our vision is for Bit by Bit's mentorship programs to provide youth with the confidence and understanding needed, to spark interest in computer science-step by step, and bit by bit.
